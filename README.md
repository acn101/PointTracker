This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Point Tracker App

This is a simple app to add custom teams and increment/decrement point values by 1 or 5. I programmed this projects to teach myself about React hooks, classes, and stateless components. You can run the app by typing the following command:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
